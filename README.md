Hey there and welcome to my application "The Cook Book" :)

  -  The purpose of the application is to provide users with access to a collection of recipes. This collection includes both a set of home recipes,
     which are taken from a Recipes API, and the ability for each user to upload their own unique recipes!
  
  - The application also provides a user-friendly interface for users to browse and search for recipes, as well as the ability to mark recipes as favorites for
    quick access later on. 

  - Overall, the application aims to bring the community of food enthusiasts together, fostering a love for cooking and trying out new dishes.
    Whether you're a seasoned cook or just starting out, this app provides a wealth of recipes at your fingertips, giving you the inspiration you need
    to create delicious meals for you and your loved ones.
    
Hope you'll enjoy!
